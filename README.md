# mathematica

A repository storing some maths projects I found muself being a part of

Including some articles like a preparatory class' report or my first year memoir in the ENS.

The main feature "mathematic_basics" is a summary of the mathematics course in preparatory classes as I experienced it.

Concerning this one, feel free to use it, but as reminded in the document, its purpose is to be an help or support for students in preparatory classes or searching to have a review of the studied topics, for example as a way to prepare an ingeneering school. Hence it shall never replace a full course, especcially those of preparatory classes.

This remains the intellectual property of my teacher and myself.
