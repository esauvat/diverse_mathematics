A summary of the mathematics program in preparatory classes

This document is a summary of my years in preparatory classes in France. 

Feel free to use it, but as reminded in the document, its purpose is to be an help or support for students in preparatory classes or searching to have a review of the studied topics, for example as a way to prepare an ingeneering school. Hence it shall never replace a full course, especcially those of preparatory classes.

This remains the intellectual property of my teacher and myself.
